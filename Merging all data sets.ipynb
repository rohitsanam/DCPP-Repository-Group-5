       " 'Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive, fatal neurologic disorder of childhood and early adolescence. It is caused by a persistent infection of the brain by an aberrant measles virus. Signs attributable to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis usually develop 4-8 years after the onset of measles infection. It is not precisely known how the measles virus remains dormant for so many years and why it becomes active again. More recent data indicate that it can follow acute measles infection in 1:10,000 cases. The incidence of SSPE is inversely related to measles vaccination coverage. In the developed world, the prevalence of SSPE has steadily declined since the introduction of the measles virus vaccine. The characteristic clinical manifestations of SSPE include behavioral abnormalities, cognitive decline, myoclonic jerks, seizures and abnormalities in vision. Clinical manifestations of SSPE usually start with subtle intellectual deterioration of the affected child causing deterioration in school performance. One of the most characteristic manifestations of SSPE is periodic myoclonic jerks that often leads to difficulty in walking and repeated falls. In the terminal stages of the disease, decerebrate and decorticate rigidity appear. Ultimately the patient becomes vegetative. Management of the disease includes seizure control and avoidance of secondary complications associated with the progressive disability. Treatment with interferon, ribavirin, and isoprinosine have reported beneficial results. However, there is no definitively effective treatment for SSPE.',\n",

Developmental delay/intellectual disability of variable degree and hypotonia are present in almost all patients. Seizures occur in around half of affected individuals. Other findings include structural brain abnormalities, congenital heart defects, eye/vision problems, hearing loss, skeletal anomalies, abnormalities of the external genitalia, and renal abnormalities. There is significant phenotypic variation among affected individuals. This variation is due, at least in part, to the genetic heterogeneity seen in 1p36 deletions which include terminal and interstitial deletions of varying lengths.',\n",

       " 'Although malignant tumors of the liver are rare during childhood, hepatoblastoma is the most common liver cancer in children, usually diagnosed during the first 3 years of life. These tumors are thought to arise from hepatic progenitors or hepatoblasts. The most frequent genetic aberrations (70-90%) in hepatoblastoma occur in genes involved in the Wnt signaling pathway. The Wnt signaling pathway is activated often by acquired activating mutations of the beta-catenin (CTNNB1) gene, and less commonly through constitutional mutations of the APC gene or somatic mutations of other genes in the pathway.',\n",
       " 'Angiosarcoma represents 1 to 2% of soft tissue tumors. It originates from endothelial cells of small blood vessels and may affect a variety of organs, including the retroperitoneum, skeletal muscle, subcutis, liver, heart and breast. Primary hepatic angiosarcomas (HAS) are much rare tumors, with worse prognosis compared with other angiosarcomas. HAS has been found to be caused by occupational exposure to vinyl chloride (VC) monomer since 1970, and the number of VC-associated HAS cases reported up to the end of 1998 was 197 worldwide. Exposure of VC connects with a series of mechanistic events leading to carcinogenic outcome; mutations of K-ras and p53 are also detected.',\n",
       " 'Cholangiocarcinoma is a highly malignant neoplasm that carries a poor prognosis and lacks effective therapy. It is the second most common primary hepatic tumor, and it is increasing in incidence and carries a high mortality. The tumor arises from the ductular epithelium of the biliary tree, either within the liver (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: ICC) or more commonly from the extrahepatic bile ducts (extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma). Several studies have demonstrated mutations resulting in overexpression of K-ras and p53 genes. These genetic alterations are associated with a more aggressive phenotype in this cancer. Many reports have implicated overexpression of the tyrosine kinase proto-oncogenes c-erbB-2 (HER-2/neu) and c-Met, as well as cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.',\n",
       " 'Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a relatively uncommon neoplasm, however its prognosis is poor with less than a 5% 5-year survival rate. There are considerable geographic differences in its incidence and etiology. Two main pathways of GBC pathogenesis have been identified. The most common is associated with gallstones and chronic inflammation of the gallbladder, whereas a second, less frequent pathway is associated with a congenital abnormality of the pancreatic bile-duct junction, which is particularly common in Japan. TP53 inactivation has an important and early role in GBC associated with gallstones and chronic inflammation. Although KRAS mutations are rarely detected in GBC associated with gallstones, they are frequent and early events in tumors associated with congenital abnormality of the pancreatic bile-duct junction.',\n",
       " \"Infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy of the pancreas. When most investigators use the term 'pancreatic cancer' they are referring to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Normal duct epithelium progresses to infiltrating cancer through a series of histologically defined precursors (PanINs). The overexpression of HER-2/neu and activating point mutations in the K-ras gene occur early, inactivation of the p16 gene at an intermediate stage, and the inactivation of p53, SMAD4, and BRCA2 occur relatively late. Activated K-ras engages multiple effector pathways. Although EGF receptors are conventionally regarded as upstream activators of RAS proteins, they can also act as RAS signal transducers via RAS-induced autocrine activation of the EGFR family ligands. Moreover, PDA shows extensive genomic instability and aneuploidy. Telomere attrition and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 are likely to contribute to these phenotypes. Inactivation of the SMAD4 tumour suppressor gene leads to loss of the inhibitory influence of the transforming growth factor-beta signalling pathway.\",\n",

They may occur sporadically or in association with a genetic syndrome, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), Von Hippel-Landau (VHL) syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, or tuberous sclerosis. The most frequent genetic alterations in PNET occur in MEN1 (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia-1 Gene), DAXX/ATRX (Death-Domain Associated Protein/Mental Retardation Syndrome X-Linked Genes) and the mTOR pathway (Mammalian Target of Rapamycin). A germline mutation in the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene causes MEN1, the above-mentioned autosomal dominant hereditary syndrome. Mutations of DAXX and ATRX are common and related to altered telomeres but not to prognosis.',\n",

GISTs account for about 80% of gastrointestinal sarcomas, with a mean annual incidence of 10-15 per million. Nearly 50-70% of the clinically apparent tumors arise in the stomach, 20-30% arise in the small intestine, 5-15% in the large intestine, and less than 5% in other locations. The genetic basis of GIST growth is a mutation of the KIT or PDGFRA gene leading to constitutional activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, which is the driving force behind tumor development.',\n",
       " 'Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector. Therefore loss of RASSF1A might shift the balance of RAS activity towards a growth-promoting effect.',\n",
       " 'Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neoplasm, which accounts for approximately 25% of all lung cancer cases. Molecular mechanisms altered in SCLC include induced expression of oncogene, MYC, and loss of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, PTEN, RB, and FHIT. The overexpression of MYC proteins in SCLC is largely a result of gene amplification. Such overexpression leads to more rapid proliferation and loss of terminal differentiation. Mutation or deletion of p53 or PTEN can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The retinoblastoma gene RB1 encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that helps to regulate cell-cycle progression. The fragile histidine triad gene FHIT encodes the enzyme diadenosine triphosphate hydrolase, which is thought to have an indirect role in proapoptosis and cell-cycle control.',\n",
       " 'Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a rare but very aggressive tumor that arises from mesothelial cells lining the pleural, peritoneal and pericardial cavities. Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is the most common type, accounting for about 70% of all MM cases. Past asbestos exposure represents the major risk factor for MPM, as the link between asbestos fibres and MPM has been largely proved by epidemiological and experimental studies. Recently, simian virus 40 (SV40) has been implicated in the aetiology of MPM. The accumulation of numerous clonal chromosomal deletions in most MMs suggests a multistep process of tumorigenesis, characterized by the loss and/or inactivation of multiple tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). Cytogenetic and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses of MMs have demonstrated frequent deletions of specific sites within chromosome arms 1p, 3p, 6q, 9p, 13q, 15q, and 22q. Furthermore, TSGs within two of these regions, i.e., p16/CDKN2A-p14ARF at 9p21 and NF2 at 22q12, are frequently altered in MMs. Mutations of the p53 gene (TP53) are occasionally observed in MMs.',\n",
       " 'Melanoma is a form of skin cancer that has a poor prognosis and which is on the rise in Western populations. Melanoma arises from the malignant transformation of pigment-producing cells, melanocytes. The only known environmental risk factor is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and in people with fair skin the risk is greatly increased. Melanoma pathogenesis is also driven by genetic factors. Oncogenic NRAS mutations activate both effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may also be activated via mutations in the BRAF gene. The PI3K-Akt pathway may be activated through loss or mutation of the inhibitory tumor suppressor gene PTEN. These mutations arise early during melanoma pathogenesis and are preserved throughout tumor progression. Melanoma development has been shown to be strongly associated with inactivation of the p16INK4a/cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6/retinoblastoma protein (p16INK4a/CDK4,6/pRb) and p14ARF/human double minute 2/p53 (p14ARF/HMD2/p53) tumor suppressor pathways. MITF and TP53 are implicated in further melanoma progression.',\n",
       " 'Cancer of the skin is the most common cancer in Caucasians and basal cell carcinomas (BCC) account for 90% of all skin cancers. The vast majority of BCC cases are sporadic, though there is a rare familial syndrome basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS, or Gorlin syndrome) that predisposes to development of BCC. In addition, there is strong epidemiological and genetic evidence that demonstrates UV exposure as a risk factor of prime importance. The development of basal cell carcinoma is associated with constitutive activation of sonic hedgehog signaling. The mutations in SMOH, PTCH1, and SHH in BCCs result in continuous activation of target genes. At a cellular level, sonic hedgehog signaling promotes cell proliferation. Mutations in TP53 are also found with high frequency (>50%) in sporadic BCC.',\n",
       " 'Non-melanoma skin cancer, i.e. basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are the most frequent tumors and their number is still increasing world- wide. Approximately 200000 cases of SCC develop per year, causing about 2000 deaths. Unlike BCCs, which have no known precursor lesions, SCCs can emerge from actinic keratoses. As with BCC, risk for development of SCC is strongly influenced by the nature and dose of UV radiation and genetic backgrounds that regulate that interaction. Mutations in TP53 have been described in actinic keratoses, in situ SCC, and invasive SCC with UV signature lesions common, and a reported mutation rate as high as 45%. As with TP53, UV-induced mutations in HRAS and KRAS have also been characterized in both actinic keratoses and SCC. The reported frequency of RAS mutations in SCCs ranges from approximately 10% to almost 50%. Several recent studies have also reported mutations of p16 in up to 24% of SCCs. In addition to UV, a pathogenic role for human papillomavirus (HPV) in the development of SCC has also been proposed.',\n",

Ultraviolet (UV) radiation may be a cause, and corresponds with the sites of these tumours, often on sun-exposed skin, mostly (94%) in the White population. UV light may exert local immunomodulating action as it decreases amount of epidermal T cells and Langerhans cells, inducing hapten tolerance. Additionally, UV- specific mutations in TP53 and Harvey (Ha)-RAS genes are present in some MCC cell lines. Recently, the polyomavirus group has been linked with MCC. The MCC polyomavirus (MCPyV) has been isolated from MCC tissue and thought to be present in up to 80% of MCC. Tumorigenesis likely is caused by a number of sequential steps from viral integration into host DNA, mutagenic events, and specific immune responses.',\n",

MF presents in the skin with erythematous patches, plaques, and less frequently, tumours. Although the aetiologies of MF are unknown, important insights have been gained in the immunological and genetic perturbations that are associated with these diseases. Mutations in the p53, p15, p16, JunB, and PTEN genes generally occur in later-stage disease. Loss of normal apoptotic T-cell pathways has also been reported. Apoptosis is partly mediated by death receptors, notably Fas, which is part of the tumor necrosis factor family of receptors. Decreased and/or defective Fas expression by neoplastic T cells has been associated with advanced/aggressive disease and impaired Fas-mediated apoptosis.',\n",

The presentation of this disease is bimodal, with peaks in adolescence and after the age of 50 years. The tumors typically arise in the metaphyseal regions of long bones, with the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus representing the three most common sites. Genomic amplification, especially of both the p53-binding MDM2 gene and the flanking SAS gene, plays an important role in the biology of these tumors.

Ewing's sarcoma is in 85% of cases associated with the translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12), which leads to the formation of the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion gene. In another 10-15% of cases the translocation t(21;12)(22;12) generates the EWSR1-ERG fusion, whereas the remaining 1-5% of cases may harbor one of several possible translocations, each resulting in a fusion gene containing a portion of the EWSR1 gene and a member of the ETS family of transcription factors.\",\n",

The tumor most commonly develops in deep parts of the proximal extremities and limb girdles in middle-aged adults, and there is a predilection for male patients. Currently, a chromosomal translocation t(9;22)(q22;q12) and the resultant fusion gene, EWSR1-NR4A3, has been defined in approximately 75% of EMC. More recently, another fusion gene, TAF15-NR4A3, resulting from t(9;17)(q22;q11.2), has been identified. The abnormal proteins resulting from these fusion genes aberrantly affect gene transcription and cellular signaling pathways thought to be responsible for initiating sarcoma formation.',\n",

Evidence indicates that KS progression occurs upon the deregulated expression of anti-apoptotic genes (Bcl-2), oncogenes (c-myc, c-int, ras) and oncosuppressor genes (TP53), and is associated with the long-lasting expression of HHV8 latency genes (LANA, v-cyc D, v-FLIP, Kaposin). All these genes are, in fact, expressed or altered in most KS spindle cells in the nodular-late stage of KS. Bcl-2 acts as a major KS progression factor, and TP53 and c-myc may also have a role in disease progression. HHV8 latency gene products may be involved in KS progression due to their capability of promoting cell growth by direct effects or antiapoptotic effects.',\n",

LSs are subclassified into well-differentiated, myxoid, round cell, and pleomorphic types. The myxoid type, the most common subtype, accounts for approximately 40% to 54% of all liposarcomas. The karyotypic hallmark of myxoid LS is the t(12;16)(q13;p11), present cytogenetically in >90% of the cases. The translocation leads to the fusion of the DDIT3(CHOP) and FUS(TLS) genes at 12q13 and 16p11, respectively, and the generation of a FUS-DDIT3 hybrid protein. In 4 cases of myxoid LS, a variant chromosomal translocation has been described, t(12;22), in which DDIT3 fuses instead with EWSR1(EWS), a gene highly related to TLS.',\n",

RMSs are presumed to be associated with the skeletal muscle lineage, although those tumors can be present in organs histologically lacking skeletal muscle, like prostate, urinary bladder or gallbladder. RMS comprises a heterogeneous into two major histologic subtypes, embryonal (ERMS) and alveolar (ARMS). Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) is a pediatric sarcoma that typically occurs in older children predominantly arising in the trunk and extremities, and exhibits a worse prognosis than other types of RMSs. ARMS is associated with 2;13 or 1;13 chromosomal translocations, which generate PAX3-FOXO1A and PAX7-FOXO1A fusion products, respectively. These translocations result in altered expression, function, and subcellular localization of the fusion products relative to the wild-type proteins, and ultimately contribute to oncogenic behavior by modifying growth, differentiation, and apoptosis pathways.',\n",

Clinically, they appear as deep-seated slowly growing masses. In more than half of the cases, metastases develop, primarily to the lungs but also to the lymph nodes and bone marrow. A specific translocation, t(X; 18)(p11.2; q11.2), is found in more than 90% of reported synovial sarcoma, including biphasic, monophasic, and poorly differentiated tumors. The breakpoints of the t(X; 18) have been cloned and shown to involve the fusion of the SYT gene at 18q11 to either of two highly homologous genes at Xp11 called SSX1 and SSX2. The SYT-SSX1 fusion is associated with biphasic morphology and a worse prognosis, whereas the SYT-SSX2 fusion tends to show monophasic morphology and better outcome.',\n",

Although it displays a relatively indolent clinical course, the ultimate prognosis is poor and is often characterised by late metastases. ASPS is characterised by an unbalanced translocation: der(17)t(X:17)(p11;q25). This translocation causes the fusion of the TEF3 (transcription factor binding to IGHM enhancer 3) with a novel gene at 17q25, named ASPL. Translocation between chromosomes X and 17 is seen in all the tested cases, implicating transcriptional deregulation in the pathogenesis of this tumor.',\n",

Clear cell sarcoma (CCS), a highly malignant tumor of deep soft tissues is perhaps the rarest of these. CCS is characterized by the translocation t(12;22)(q13;q12). This translocation rearranges the ATF1 gene at 12q13 and the EWSR1 gene at 22q12, originating an EWSR1/ATF1 fusion gene.

Studies have shown relatively increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (VEGFr1-3) in human angiosarcoma. The most common gene mutation in angiosarcomas is KRAS as well as other RAS mutations. Activation of the RAS pathway is often tumorigenic.

Most reported PPC cases are primary peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma (PPSPC), while peritoneal mixed epithelial carcinoma (MEC) and malignant mixed Mullerian tumor (MMMT) are rarely reported. Germline BRCA1 mutations in 26% of PPSPC patients was detected. BRCA1 mutation carriers had a higher overall incidence of p53 mutations than wildtype BRCA1 case subjects.

Ovarian epithelial tumors are divided into mucinous, serous, endometrioid, and clear cell subtypes. Approximately 10% of ovarian cancers arise in women who have inherited mutations in cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 or BRCA2).

Recent genetic and immunohistochemical studies strongly suggest that high-grade serous adenocarcinoma (SAC) involving the ovary likely arises from distal fallopian tube epithelium, indicating that some ovarian cancers develop in the fallopian tube and are then spread to the ovary. Fallopian tube cancers are similar to ovarian cancer with respect to the proportion of tumors with abnormal expression of c-erbB-2 and p53. It has been proposed that the p53 signature is the earliest step in the pathogenesis of fallopian tube cancer. In this model, tubal epithelium on the fimbria experiences genotoxic damage and, as a result, the secretory cell exhibits over-accumulation of p53 protein (p53 signature). There is also some evidence that BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutations and c-myc have a major role in tumorgenesis.',\n",

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the predominant tumor type in penile cancer, accounting for 95% of cases. Penile cancers are thought to arise from the progression of precursor lesions and can be subdivided into human papilloma virus (HPV) positive and HPV negative cases. Most common disrupted pathways, both in HPV-mediated and HPV-independent penile carcinogenesis, involve the p14ARF/MDM2/p53 and/or p16INK4a/cyclin D/Rb pathways. HPVs exert their oncogenic effect by expressing the oncoproteins E6 and E7, which bind to and inactivate the p53 and Rb tumor suppressor gene products, respectively. HPV independent mechanisms of pathway inactivation include silencing of the p16INK4a gene by promoter hypermethylation, somatic mutations of the p53 gene, over-expression of MDM2 and mutation of p14ARF.

       " 'Prostate cancer constitutes a major health problem in Western countries. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that is normally activated by its androgen ligand. During androgen withdrawal therapy, the AR signal transduction pathway also could be activated by amplification of the AR gene, by AR gene mutations, or by altered activity of AR coactivators. Through these mechanisms, tumor cells lead to the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer.',\n",

Overall, three different entities of TGCT can be distinguished: teratomas and yolk sac tumors of newborns and infants, seminomatous and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors of adolescents and young adults, and spermatocytic seminoma of elderly men. Recent studies of TGCTs have suggested that overexpression of cyclin D2 is a very early, possibly the oncogenic, event in GC tumorigenesis.',\n",
       " 'Renal cell cancer (RCC) accounts for ~3% of human malignancies and its incidence appears to be rising. Although most cases of RCC seem to occur sporadically, an inherited predisposition to renal cancer accounts for 1-4% of cases. RCC is not a single disease, it has several morphological subtypes. Conventional RCC (clear cell RCC) accounts for ~80% of cases, followed by papillary RCC (10-15%), chromophobe RCC (5%), and collecting duct RCC (<1%). Genes potentially involved in sporadic neoplasms of each particular type are VHL, MET, BHD, and FH respectively. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Activated MET mediates a number of biological effects including motility, invasion of extracellular matrix, cellular transformation, prevention of apoptosis and metastasis formation. Loss of functional FH leads to accumulation of fumarate in the cell, triggering inhibition of HPH and preventing targeted pVHL-mediated degradation of HIF-alpha. BHD mutations cause the Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome and its associated chromophobe, hybrid oncocytic, and conventional (clear cell) RCC.',\n",

Typically, nephroblastoma comprises three histological components namely blastemal, epithelial and stromal. WT1, a zinc-finger transcription factor, was identified as the first nephroblastoma gene. Several other genes including CTNNB1, WTX, and TP53 have also been implicated in various stages of tumorigenesis of nephroblastoma.',\n",

The majority of urothelial carcinoma are bladder carcinomas, and urothelial carcinomas of the renal pelvis and ureter account for only approximately 7% of the total. Urothelial tumours arise and evolve through divergent phenotypic pathways. Some tumours progress from urothelial hyperplasia to low-grade non-invasive superficial papillary tumours. More aggressive variants arise either from flat, high-grade carcinoma in situ (CIS) and progress to invasive tumours, or they arise de novo as invasive tumours. Low-grade papillary tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. In contrast, CIS and invasive tumors frequently show alterations in the TP53 and RB genes and pathways. Invasion and metastases are promoted by several factors that alter the tumour microenvironment, including the aberrant expression of E-cadherins (E-cad), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).',\n",
       " 'The retinoblastoma is an eye tumor of childhood that arises in the retina and represents the most common intraocular malignancy of infancy and childhood. Tumor formation usually begins with mutation in both alleles of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene RB1, followed by a series of other genetic alterations that correlate with the clinical stage and pathologic findings of the tumor. In retinoblastoma, mutation of RB1 leads to dysfunction or absence of the Rb protein. These mutations promote tumour development by deregulating the E2F family of transcription factors leading to uncontrolled cell cycle progression.',\n",

Gliomas include tumours that are composed predominantly of astrocytes (astrocytomas), oligodendrocytes (oligodendrogliomas), mixtures of various glial cells (for example,oligoastrocytomas) and ependymal cells (ependymomas). The most malignant form of infiltrating astrocytoma - glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) - is one of the most aggressive human cancers. GBM may develop de novo (primary glioblastoma) or by progression from low-grade or anaplastic astrocytoma (secondary glioblastoma). Primary glioblastomas develop in older patients and typically show genetic alterations (EGFR amplification, p16/INK4a deletion, and PTEN mutations) at frequencies of 24-34%. Secondary glioblastomas develop in younger patients and frequently show overexpression of PDGF and CDK4 as well as p53 mutations (65%) and loss of Rb playing major roles in such transformations. Loss of PTEN has been implicated in both pathways, although it is much more common in the pathogenesis of primary GBM.',\n",

Recently, four distinct molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma have been identified [WNT (wingless), SHH (sonic hedgehog), Group 3, and Group 4]. Nearly all (90 %) of WNT patients have somatic missense mutations in CTNNB1 which promote protein stabilization. Alterations in SHH subgroup most often fall within the Shh signalling pathway. The most common are somatic or germline inactivating alterations or loss of PTCH1 and SUFU, or somatic missense mutations activating SMO. Group 3 tumors are characterized by MYC amplification resulting in high MYC mRNA expression levels compared with SHH and Group 4 tumors.The most frequently mutated somatic gene in Group 4 medulloblastoma is KDM6A, a histone H3 Lys27 (H3K27) demethylase.',\n",

Approximately one-half of children have localized tumors that can be cured with surgery alone. These favorable tumors are characterized by near-triploid karyotypes with whole chromosome gains. These tumors rarely have structural rearrangements, and they usually express the TrkA neurotrophin receptor. Patients with these tumors are more likely to be less than 1 year of age. The remaining children have widespread metastatic disease or quite large, aggressive, localized tumors. These unfavorable tumors are characterized by structural changes, including deletions of 1p or 11q, unbalanced gain of 17q and/or amplification of the MYCN protooncogene. They might also express the TrkB neurotrophin receptor and its ligand, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).

       " 'Meningiomas are the second-most common central nervous system tumor in adults. These tumors arise from arachnoid cells of the meninges, the covering layer of the brain. The majority of meningiomas tend to be benign, localized, and non-invasive. However, some meningiomas tend to be more aggressive with tendencies toward invasion of the surrounding brain, high propensity for recurrence, and in rare cases extracranial metastasis. Hereditary factors and ionizing radiation play an important role in the initiation of at least some meningiomas. Inactivation of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene is likely responsible for the initiation of more than half of all meningiomas and may cause a mesenchymal-like cytomorphology. Recently, novel mutations have been discovered in non-NF2 meningiomas. The somatic mutations in components of the SHH-GLI1 and AKT1-MTOR signaling pathways indicates the potential for cross talk of these pathways in the development of meningiomas.',\n",

More than 95% of thyroid carcinomas are derived from follicular cells. Their behavior varies from the indolent growing, well-differentiated papillary and follicular carcinomas (PTC and FTC, respectively) to the extremely aggressive undifferentiated carcinoma (UC). Somatic rearrangements of RET and TRK are almost exclusively found in PTC and may be found in early stages. The most distinctive molecular features of FTC are the prominence of aneuploidy and the high prevalence of RAS mutations and PAX8-PPAR{gamma} rearrangements. p53 seems to play a crucial role in the dedifferentiation process of thyroid carcinoma.',\n",

A subset of MTC cases is hereditary and due to germline mutations in the RET tyrosine kinase receptor gene. Somatic mutations in either RET or RAS are also present in most sporadic tumors. In MTC, RET mutations lead to substrate-independent dimerization of the receptor causing constitutive activation, unrestricted signaling, and ultimately, cancer.',\n",

The incidence of ACC ranges from 0.5 to 2 cases per million people per year, accounting for 0.02% of all reported cancers. Unfortunately, most patients present with metastatic disease which reduces the 5 year survival rate to less than 10%. Oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes involved in adrenal carcinomas include mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene and rearrangements of the chromosomal locus 11p15.5 associated with IGF II hyperexpression.

Malignancy is defined by presence of metastases, tumor spread in sites where chromaffin tissue is normally absent such as lymph nodes, liver, lungs, and bones. Malignant PGLs are extremely rare. The pathogenesis and progression of PGLs are very strongly influenced by genetics. A germline mutation in one of the susceptibility genes identified so far explains ~40% of all cases; the remaining 60% are thought to be sporadic cases. Sporadic as well as hereditary PGLs have been divided in two main clusters linked to two different signalling pathways: the first cluster contains all VHL-, SDHx-, and FH- mutated tumors and is associated to the activation of hypoxic pathway, while the second cluster contains all RET- , NF1-, MAX and TMEM127- mutated tumors and is associated to the activation of MAPK and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathways.',\n",

Over 90% of patients present with excess parathyroid hormone (PTH), representing <1-5% of all patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. PC is associated with mutations in the HRPT2/CDC73 gene and with decreased parafibromin and calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) expression. Negative parafibromin staining together with a CDC73 gene mutation increases the likelihood of malignancy and also predicts the clinical outcome, namely local invasion and/or metastases and mortality.

About 95% of cases are classical HL, and 5% are nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL). A characteristic feature of HL is the rareness of the tumor cells, which are called Hodgkin's and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical HL and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells in NLPHL. These cells represent only about 1% of the cellular infiltrate, while the vast majority of infiltrating cells are T lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes and plasma cells. HRS cells show constitutive activity of both the classical and alternative NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways, which is probably a major pathogenetic mechanism in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The NF-{kappa}B activity in HRS cells is probably mediated by diverse mechanisms: receptor signalling through CD40, RANK, BCMA, and TACI, genomic REL amplification, destructive mutations in IKBA and IKBE. In HL pathogenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, the activation of NF-{kappa}B is induced by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).\",\n",

The natural history of CML has a triphasic clinical course comprising of an initial chronic phase (CP), which is characterized by expansion of functionally normal myeloid cells, followed by an accelerated phase (AP) and finally a more aggressive blast phase (BP), with loss of terminal differentiation capacity. On the cellular level, CML is associated with a specific chromosome abnormality, the t(9; 22) reciprocal translocation that forms the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome is the result of a molecular rearrangement between the c-ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9 and the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22. The BCR/ABL fusion gene encodes p210 BCR/ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. While fusion of c-ABL and BCR is believed to be the primary cause of the chronic phase of CML, progression to blast crisis requires other molecular changes. Common secondary abnormalities include mutations in TP53, RB, and p16/INK4A, or overexpression of genes such as EVI1.

Gain-of-function mutations in the proto-oncogene c-kit that induce constitutive kinase activity of its product, KIT protein, are characteristic of various neoplastic diseases including MCL. Downstream signaling pathways, including PI3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT, are inappropriately activated, and this is believed to contribute to the abnormal proliferation and survival of these neoplastic cells. The reason why the prognosis of patients with MCL is mostly that MCs in these patients are largely resistant against conventional drugs and targeted drugs, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) directed against KIT D816V such as PKC412 (midostaurin).',\n",
       " 'Myelofibrosis (MF), one of the three classic Philadelphia-chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), is characterized by symptoms mainly derived from anemia and splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms and associated with a median survival around 6 years. Most MPN patients harbor an acquired mutation in the hemopoietic cells, the V617F mutation, located in the pseudokinase domain of the JAK2 gene. This mutation results in a gain of function, i.e., in the constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, which plays an important role in the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of the hemopoietic cells, as well as in the immune function. Besides, a minority of patients with MF (most of them negative for the JAK2 mutation) harbor other JAK-STAT-activating mutation, the MPL mutation, in the gene of the receptor of the thrombopoietin. Recently, mutations in the CALR gene have been described in 86% of cases with primary MF that are negative for JAK2 or MPL mutations. CALR mutation also showed cytokine independent growth of cells due to activation of STAT5 involved with the JAK-STAT pathway but its exact role in MPN remains to be clarified.',\n",

Its clinical presentation is variable and ranges from isolated skin or bone disease to a life-threatening multisystem condition. Historically, it has been hypothesized that the disease originated from epidermal Langerhans cells. However, new evidence supports a model in which LCH occurs as a consequence of a misguided differentiation programme of myeloid dendritic cell precursors. In LCH, there is a very high frequency of activating mutations in MAPK signaling pathway genes, most notably BRAF-V600E, as well as MAP2K1. Genetic, molecular and functional data implicate activation of the MAPK (ERK) signalling pathway at critical stages in myeloid differentiation as an essential and universal driver of LCH pathology.',\n",

Among the more common sites of involvement are the skeleton, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, lungs, kidneys (retroperitoneum) and skin. Recent studies have described that the etiology of ECD may be associated with the V600E BRAF mutation and an array of other activating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway mutations, suggesting a critical role of this pathway in the pathogenesis and a possible clonal origin of the disease.',\n",

In most patients with CEL (about 60%), eosinophils display PDGFRA-fusion genes and related cytogenetic defects. The most commonly detected oncoprotein is FIP1L1/PDGFRA. FIP1L1-PDGFRA is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase, which is suggested to induce the proliferation of EoL-1 (The eosinophilic leukemia cell line) cells by inducing c-Myc expression at the mRNA level via ERK and JNK signaling pathways.',\n",
       " 'Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a heterogeneous group of rare disorders characterized by marked blood or tissue eosinophilia resulting in a wide variety of clinical manifestations. A number of HES subtypes, or variants, have recently been identified. The best characterized of the clonal molecular defects implicated in myeloproliferative variant HES is the 800-kb interstitial deletion on chromosome 4q12 resulting in the fusion of 2 distinct genes, Fip1-like 1 (FIP1L1) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-a (PDGFRA), leading to the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion kinase. PDGFR is a membrane-bound tyrosine kinase receptor and the fusion PDGFRA kinase has constitutive/unregulated tyrosine kinase activity. The lymphocytic HES variant is associated with T-cell clones producing interleukin-5 (IL-5) and can evolve into lymphoma. While myeloproliferative and lymphocytic HES are well established and permit elimination of the term, idiopathic, to these varieties, most HES patients do not fall into these categories and are classified as complex.',\n",

ET is characterized by an isolated thrombocytosis and overlaps clinically with polycythemia vera and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). The V617F mutation in the tyrosine pseudokinase region of the JAK2 gene is found in 50 - 60% of ET patients. This mutation produces an increased tyrosine kinase activity of JAK2, resulting in uncontrolled cellular growth in the hematopoietic compartment.

Most solid tumors are derived from epithelial cells. Carcinomas are tumors that form in epithelial cells. Neoplastic epithelial cells generate aggressive cancers such as those located in the lung, breast, colon, prostate and ovary. Some cancers of the bladder ureters and kidneys are transitional cell carcinomas. Sarcomas are tumors that start in tissues like a blood vessel, bone, fat tissue, ligament, lymph vessel, muscle or tendon.

       " 'Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.',\n",
       " 'Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease characterised by the production of IgG autoantibodies that are specific for self-antigens, such as DNA, nuclear proteins and certain cytoplasmic components, in association with a diverse array of clinical manifestations. The primary pathological findings in patients with SLE are those of inflammation, vasculitis, immune complex deposition, and vasculopathy. Immune complexes comprising autoantibody and self-antigen is deposited particulary in the renal glomeruli and mediate a systemic inflammatory response by activating complement or via Fc{gamma}R-mediated neutrophil and macrophage activation. Activation of complement (C5) leads to injury both through formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) or by generation of the anaphylatoxin and cell activator C5a. Neutrophils and macrophages cause tissue injury by the release of oxidants and proteases.',\n",

Progressive thyrocyte depletion results in impaired thyroid hormone production and clinical hypothyroidism, a condition that involves a marked reduction of metabolic activity in various cells and tissues. AITDs are regarded as polygenic disorders resulting from the combination of a genetic predisposition in conjunction with an environmental trigger. Two main approaches have been employed to locate susceptibility loci for AITD, namely case control candidate gene studies and genome-wide linkage screens. Case control candidate gene studies have been employed to investigate numerous genes for association with AITD, but to date, only the human leucocyte region (HLA) on chromosome 6p21 and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated 4 (CTLA-4) gene on chromosome 2q33 have been consistently shown to be associated with disease.',\n",

       " \"Allograft rejection is the consequence of the recipient's alloimmune response to nonself antigens expressed by donor tissues. After transplantation of organ allografts, there are two pathways of antigen presentation. In the direct pathway, recipient T cells react to intact allogeneic MHC molecules expressed on the surface of donor cells. This pathway would activate host CD4 or CD8 T cells. In contrast, donor MHC molecules (and all other proteins) shed from the graft can be taken up by host APCs and presented to recipient T cells in the context of self-MHC molecules - the indirect pathway. Such presentation activates predominantly CD4 T cells. A direct cytotoxic T-cell attack on graft cells can be made only by T cells that recognize the graft MHC molecules directly. Nontheless, T cells with indirect allospecificity can contribute to graft rejection by activating macrophages, which cause tissue injury and fibrosis, and are also likely to be important in the development of an alloantibody response to graft.\",\n",
       " 'Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a lethal complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) where immunocompetent donor T cells attack the genetically disparate host cells. GVHD pathophysiology can be summerized in a three-step process. Step 1 involves the development of an inflammatory milieu resulting from damage in the host tissues induced by the preparative chemotherapy or radiotherapy regimen. Damaged tissues secrete inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha ). During step 2, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) trigger the activation of donor-derived T cells, which induce further T-cell expansion, induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells responses and prime additional mononuclear phagocytes to produce TNF-alpha and IL-1. Also, nitric oxide (NO) is produced by activated macrophages, and it may contribute to the tissue damage seen during step 3. During step 3, the effector phase, activated CTL and NK cells mediate cytotoxicity against target host cells through Fas-Fas ligand interactions and perforin-granzyme B.',\n",

This induces a hypersensitivity response in the distal bronchioles and alveoli and subjects may present clinically with a variety of symptoms. EAA is caused by a wide variety of antigens including bacteria, organic materials, fungal spores, and chemicals. Of the various EAA syndromes, Farmer's lung and Bird fancier's disease are the commonest forms that have been studied. EEA is a complex dynamic clinical syndrome where clinical expression depends on the frequency and amount of contact with antigen and host susceptibility. The manifestations and symptoms can be complicated by self-regulatory measures performed by those affected individuals to reduce antigen exposure. There are many individuals with a positive antibody reaction who remain asymptomatic. EEA traditionally has been described as occurring in a state of acute, subacute, and chronic form.\",\n",
       " 'Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that primarily manifests as chronic inflammatory arthropathy. Persistent synovitis leads to cartilage destruction, bone erosions and periarticular decalcification, subsequently resulting in impaired joint function. It is more common between the ages of 35 and 50 years, affecting three times more women than men. Susceptibility to RA is genetically determined with multiple genes contributing. Inheritance of HLA DRB1 alleles encoding a distinctive five-amino-acid sequence known as the \"shared epitope\" (SE) is the best characterized genetic risk factor. The mechanism by which the SE alleles contribute to the development of RA is not very clear. It has been postulated that the presence of these conserved sequences in the antigen-binding groove alters the way antigenic peptides are bound to and presented to T-cell lymphocytes. This, in turn, may trigger abnormal immune responses and lead to RA.',\n",

Common laboratory abnormalities include neutrophilic leukocytosis, abnormal liver function tests, and elevated acute-phase reactants (ESR, CRP, ferritin). The exact pathogenesis of AOSD is unknown. Several factors such as genetics, infectious (bacterial and viral) agents, and environmental factors have been thought to play a causative role. Although no familial trend has been reported in AOSD, some studies have reported an association between AOSD and gene polymorphism of HLA, IL-18, and MEFV. Recent advances have revealed a pivotal role of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-18 in disease pathogenesis. Treatment consists of anti-inflammatory medications.

Some, but not all, muscles are affected and not necessarily symmetrically. Increased weakness with continued muscle activity represents a diagnostic clue for MG, but these clinical features can vary. MG is B-cell mediated, and is associated with antibodies directed against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), muscle-specific kinase (MUSK), lipoprotein-related protein 4 (LRP4), or agrin in the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction. Patients should be classified into subgroups to help with therapeutic decisions and prognosis. Subgroups based on serum antibodies and clinical features include early-onset, late-onset, thymoma, MUSK, LRP4, antibody-negative, and ocular forms of myasthenia gravis. Agrin-associated MG might emerge as a new entity. The prognosis is good with optimum symptomatic, immunosuppressive, and supportive treatment. The evolution of MG is unpredictable, but it is generally characterized by the occurrence of relapses, sometimes subsequent to remissions and a worsening trend.

CLE is a frequent finding in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and can also exist as a single entity without associated systemic autoimmunity (LE-specific skin disease). Despite ongoing research into the cause of CLE, it remains unclear how CLE relates to SLE pathogenesis. LE-specific skin disease includes the subtypes of CLE such as acute cutaneous LE (ACLE), subacute cutaneous LE (SCLE), chronic cutaneous LE (CCLE), and intermittent CLE (ICLE). ACLE is characterized by malar rash or maculopapular eruption on sun exposed areas. SCLE characteristically presents as annular or psoriasiform plaques in a photo distribution. CCLE can be further divided into discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), LE profundus (LEP), chilblain LE (CLE), and LE tumidus (LET). The pathogenesis of CLE is multifactorial and involves genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and abnormalities in the immune response. It has been reported that many genetic risk factors for CLE involve HLA or interferon-related pathways. Corticosteroids and antimalarials were considered as the most suitable and effective systemic drugs for CLE patients.',\n",

Clinically, LEMS patients suffer from characteristic muscle weakness and autonomic symptoms. The underlying cause of LEMS in slightly more than half of all patients is small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) [DS:H00013]. The nerve terminal and carcinoma cells apparently share a common antigen (VGCC), suggesting an immunological cross-reactivity that may lead to the neurological abnormality. Cancer therapy is the priority for these patients. As for the remaining cases, no antibodies to P/Q-type VGCCs have been found in 10-15% of patients with LEMS. The fact that these seronegative patients positively respond to immunotherapy leads to the presumption that antibodies to other proteins might play a role in LEMS. Diagnosis of LEMS is ascertained on the basis of clinical symptoms and is further supported by electrophysiological and serological tests. The clinical triad in LEMS consists of weakness predominantly affecting proximal muscle groups, autonomic dysfunctions, and areflexia.

JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA is macrophage activation syndrome. Polymorphisms in the IL6 and in the MIF gene have been found to be associated with susceptibility to the disorder. Based on the known relevance of IL6 in JIA pathophysiology, tocilizumab has been investigated and approved for use in the treatment of systemic and polyarticular JIA.\",\n",
       " \"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), formerly also known as Bechterew's disease, is a rheumatic disease of the axial skeleton that mainly affects the spine and the sacroiliac joint in the pelvis. AS is one of a group of inflammatory diseases, called spondyloarthritides, which share features. This disease is characterized by erosion, sclerosis, and ossification, which may result in complete fusion and rigidity of the spine. Regarding extra-articular manifestations, the most frequent is anterior uveitis. The major functional losses occur during the first 10 years of disease. It usually begins in the second or third decade of life, preferentially in HLA-B27-positive Caucasian males. Its etiology and pathogenesis are not completely understood, but the most prevalent hypothesis involves immune mediation as its major mechanism, including several cytokines. To date, more than 40 genetic variants have been identified that influence the risk of developing AS, including HLA alleles such as HLA-B27.\",\n",
       " 'Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic inflammatory liver disorder with an etiology that remains unclear. The pathogenesis may be a result of alterations in immune tolerance, a genetic predisposition and environmental conditions, which in collaboration induce a T-cell-mediated attack on liver antigens, leading to necro-inflammation and liver damage. AIH has marked female predilection. AIH can present at all ages, but the two peak ages of incidence are in childhood or adolescence and at around 40 years of age. Trademark biochemical/serological characteristics of AIH are elevated aminotransferase levels, positivity for autoantibodies and increased IgG. A histological picture of interface hepatitis is typical of AIH. The value of immunosuppressive therapy with glucocorticoids, alone or in combination with azathioprine, was well documented in numerous studies of AIH.',\n",

The most common clinical manifestations of this disease are Raynaud's phenomenon, arthralgias, swollen joints, esophageal dysfunction, muscle weakness and fingers sausage-like appearance. The disease can be serious with development of pulmonary, kidney, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and central nervous system manifestations. The worst prognosis and high mortality are associated with the presence of pulmonary disease. Therapy should be individualised for each patient to address the specific organs involved and the severity of underlying disease activity. Inflammatory manifestations usually respond to steroid treatment, whereas clinical sclerodermatous manifestations such as sclerodactyly, and pulmonary interstitial disease more often require cytotoxic immunosuppressive treatment.\",\n",

Clinically, GS is characterized by pulmonary hemorrhage and renal failure, although the clinical spectrum may range from only mild symptoms to a relentless and finally lethal outcome. This disease accounts for 10-20% of the patients with acute renal failure following a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. The disease is caused by an autoimmune response against the non-collagenase domain of the alpha 3 chain of type IV collagen [alpha3(IV)NC1], found in the glomerular and alveolar basement membranes. Without prompt diagnosis and treatment, the disease can lead to bleeding in the lungs, kidney failure, and even death. Early and intensive treatment with plasmapheresis and immunosuppression with systemic corticosteroids pending results of diagnostic testing, and later cyclophosphamide, is often beneficial, with 90% of patients surviving the acute presentation of GS.',\n",
       " 'Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) represents a pattern of glomerular injury, characterized by mesangial proliferation and expansion, lobularization of the glomerular tufts and double contours. Classification of MPGN has been updated in the 2010s, and is now categorized according to the immunofluorescence microscopy findings. Until recently, the MPGNs have been distinguished according to the histological and ultra structural findings and were classified as MPGN type I, type II and type III. A new terminology that distinguishes immunoglobulin-mediated MPGN (ie, the former type I) from complement-mediated MPGN has been proposed. Immune-complexes mediated MPGN is caused by the deposition of immunocomplexes in the glomeruli. The immunocomplexes activate the classical pathway (CP) of complement and cause the deposition of complement factors or of the membrane attack complex (MAC) in the mesangium and capillary loops. The most frequent underlying disorders associated with immune complex MPGN include chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, and monoclonal gammopathies. The complement-mediated MPGN, termed C3 glomerulopathy, is characterised by defects in the alternative pathway of complement, in particular of factor H, or autoantibodies to complement-regulatory proteins (so-called C3 nephritic factors) leading to increased complement activation. The group includes dense deposit disease (DDD) and C3 glomerulonephritis. The two entities are distinguished on the basis of the immunohistological pattern of C3 and the electron microscopy detection of ribbon-like electron-dense deposits in the glomerular basement membrane in DDD, versus deposits of usual density in C3 glomerulonephritis.',\n",

This disease has specific features of elevated serum IgE level, active reaction to mite or cedar pollen specific antigen and stepwise progression of mostly the sensory symptoms. Atopic myelitis is often with coexistent atopic diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis and food allergies. Although the pathogenesis is still poorly understood, it has been reported that CCL11 and IL-9 were significantly increased in patients with atopic myelitis. Upregulation of CCL11 and IL-9 explain quite well the eosinophilic inflammation of the spinal cord. It has been suggested that immunotherapy, such as corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and plasma exchanges (PE), are effective in atopic myelitis, and that PE is the most beneficial immunotherapy.',\n",

Defects in early B cell development are characterized by the onset of recurrent bacterial infections in the first 5 years of life, profound hypogammaglobulinemia, markedly reduced or absent B cells in the peripheral circulation, and (in the bone marrow) a severe block in B cell differentiation before the production of surface immunoglobulin-positive B cells. Mutations in Btk, the gene responsible for X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), account for approximately 85% of affected patients. Approximately half of the remaining patients have mutations in genes encoding components of the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) or BCR, including mu heavy chain (IGHM); the signal transduction molecules Ig-alpha (CD79A) and Ig-beta (CD79B); and lambda 5 (IGLL1), which forms the surrogate light chain with Vpre-B.

Seventy per cent of the cases are X-linked in inheritance, and others are autosomal recessive. In the autosomal recessive hyper IgM syndromes, the problem lies in the nucleotide-editing enzymes AICD or UNG.

Patients have variable hypogammaglobulinemia but typically have profound reduction or absence of two or more Ig isotypes. This leads to severe immunodeficiency and death due to infection often before adulthood. Deficiencies of B-cell receptors are caused by mutations in the genes that encode immunoglobulin heavy or light chains or their associated signaling molecules, leading to agammaglobulinemia or hypogammaglobulinemia. Mutations in immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes (such as gamma1, 2, 3, or 4; alpha1 or 2; and epsilon) cause deficiencies of individual classes or subclasses of immunoglobulins, but circulating B cells are present and overall antibody function is usually normal.

SCIDs with lack of circulating T cells but a normal number of B cells accounts for 30 to 50% of all cases of human SCIDs. The most frequent form of SCID, X-linked SCID (SCID-X1), is caused by mutations in the gamma-chain-encoding gene. Gamma-chain is a common subunit shared by several cytokine receptors. It results in an absence of both mature T lymphocytes and NK lymphocytes. The second most common variant is autosomal recessive and due to mutations of the JAK3 gene. IL-7R alpha gene mutations result in a pure T-cell deficiency. Rare cases of SCID consisting of pure T-cell deficiencies have been attributed to defects in key proteins involved in pre-TCR/TCR signaling.

Hyper-IgM syndrome (HIM) represents a group of distinct entities characterized by defective normal or elevated IgM in the presence of diminished IgG and IgA levels. The genetic anomaly in X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome has been mapped to Xq26, and resides in mutations of the CD40 ligand gene. Missense mutation in exon 7 of the common gamma chain (IL2RG) causes a moderate form of X-linked CID. This point mutation in IL2RG leads to a less severe degree of deficiency in cellular and humoral immunity than that seen in XSCID. Two related deficiencies of recombination activating genes, RAG1 and RAG2 result in a spectrum of SCID called RAG1/RAG2 deficiency and Omenn syndrome. Mutations that lead to total absence of RAG1 or RAG2 gene product (null mutations) are known to lead to SCID without mature lymphoid cells, whereas mutations that result in partial V(D)J recombinase activity due to missense mutation on at least one allele lead to Omenn syndrome. Mutations of both TAP1 and TAP2 genes result in deficient expression of class I HLA proteins on the cell surface with defects in natural killer cell cytotoxicity. Defective expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules account for 5% of SCID. The genetic lesions responsible for this syndrome do not lie within the MHC-II locus itself, but reside instead in genes encoding transcription factors, RFX5, RFXAP, RFXANK(B), and CIITA, controlling MHC-II expression.

MBL deficiency is one of the most common human immunodeficiencies and arises primarily from three single point mutations in exon 1 of the MBL-2 gene. These mutations result in a failure to assemble fully functional multimeric protein. Inherited MASP-2 deficiency has been described as the result of a mutation causing the exchange of aspartic acid with a glycine at position 105, a position in the first domain, CUB1, involved in calcium binding. This mutation abolishes the binding to MBL and ficolins, and deprives MASP-2 of functional activity.',\n",

They include C1 inhibitor (C1-INH, also termed SERPING1), C4 binding protein (C4BP), Factor I, decay accelerating factor (DAF), CD59, and so on. C1-INH (SERPING1) deficiency can be genetic or acquired, and this causes an episodic, local increase in vascular permeability in the subcutaneous and submucosal layers, identified as angioedema (hereditary or acquired). Genetic deficiency of C4BP has only been reported in one individual who developed an illness with similarities to Behcet's syndrome. Heterozygous mutations within the Factor I gene have been recently identified in individuals with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), while homozygous deficiency of Factor I is an unusual feature. Factor I-deficient patients present high susceptibility to respiratory tract infections and meningitis. Kidney impairment and autoimmune disorders have also been observed.

Hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES) is characterized by atopic dermatitis associated with extremely high serum IgE levels and susceptibility to infections with extracellular bacteria. Dominant-negative mutations in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) gene result in the classical multisystem form of HIES, whereas a null mutation in the tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) gene causes an autosomal recessive HIES associated with viral and mycobacterial infections. X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP) is a rare primary immunodeficiency, with manifestations ranging from fatal infectious mononucleosis to B cell lymphomas and hypogammaglobulinemia. Mutations in the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) as well as in a distinct gene, SLAM-associated protein (SAP/DSP1/SH2D1A) have been identified in patients with XLP. Recently, it has been shown that a homozygous mutation in the SH2 domain of the IL-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) gene is associated with fatal Epstein Barr virus associated lymphoproliferation, with a clinical picture similar to that seen in XLP. Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy and X-linked (IPEX) syndrome and autoimmune polyendocrinopathy, candidiasis, ectodermal dysplasia (APECED) are examples of dysregulated immunity resulting in a disturbed tolerance and multiple autoimmune phenomena. IPEX is caused by mutations in the FOXP3 gene, and APECED results from mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene.

Sydenham chorea occurs in approximately 10% of acute rheumatic fever and is one of its major manifestations. The disease may last for weeks or months, with a high risk of recurrence. The common features of rheumatic fever include sore throats due to streptococcal infections, rashes, pains in the limbs, and subcutaneous nodules, and this form of chorea typically presents, after varying intervals, with twitching of the mouth and limbs, shrugging of the shoulders, and clumsy gait. Those with this form of chorea are less likely to have severe cardiac or rheumatologic complications. The pathogenesis has been considered to be an autoantibody-mediated basal ganglia dysfunction.

       " 'Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specfically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. It was proposed that Abeta form Ca2+ permeable pores and bind to and modulate multiple synaptic proteins, including NMDAR, mGluR5 and VGCC, leading to the overfilling of neurons with calcium ions. Consequently, cellular Ca2+ disruptions will lead to neuronal apoptosis, autophagy deficits, mitochondrial abnormality, defective neurotransmission, impaired synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration in AD. FAD-linked PS1 mutation downregulates the unfolded protein response and leads to vulnerability to ER stress.',\n",

Both environmental factors and mutations in familial PD-linked genes such as SNCA, Parkin, DJ-1, PINK1 and LRRK2 are associated with PD pathogenesis. These pathogenic mutations and environmental factors are known to cause disease due to oxidative stress, intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis impairment, mitochondrial dysfunctions and altered protein handling compromising key roles of DA neuronal function and survival. The demise of DA neurons located in the SNc leads to a drop in the dopaminergic input to the striatum, which is hypothesized to impede movement by inducing hypo and hyper activity in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the direct (dSPNs) and indirect (iSPNs) pathways in the basal ganglia, respectively.',\n",

The etiology of these diseases is thought to be associated with the conversion of a normal protein, PrPC, into an infectious, pathogenic form, PrPSc. The conversion is induced by prion infections (for example, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), iatrogenic CJD, Kuru), mutations (familial CJD, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia (FFI)) or unknown factors (sporadic CJD (sCJD)), and is thought to occur after PrPC has reached the plasma membrane or is re-internalized for degradation. The PrPSc form shows greater protease resistance than PrPC and accumulates in affected individuals, often in the form of extracellular plaques. Pathways that may lead to neuronal death comprise oxidative stress, regulated activation of complement, ubiquitin-proteasome and endosomal-lysosomal systems, synaptic alterations and dendritic atrophy, corticosteroid response, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. In addition, the conformational transition could lead to the lost of a beneficial activity of the natively folded protein, PrPC.',\n",

In the United States, histoplasmosis commonly occurs in the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys, though it can occur in other areas, too. It also occurs in Africa, Asia, Australia, and in parts of Central and South America.Most people with histoplasmosis never develop symptoms and aren't aware they're infected. But for some people — primarily infants and those with compromised immune systems — histoplasmosis can be serious. Treatments are available for even the most severe forms of histoplasmosis.Products & ServicesBook: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book, 5th EditionNewsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital EditionShow more products from Mayo Clinic\",\n",

Noninfectious keratitis can be caused by a relatively minor injury, by wearing your contact lenses too long or by a foreign body in the eye. Infectious keratitis can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites.If you have eye redness or other symptoms of keratitis, make an appointment to see your doctor. With prompt attention, mild to moderate cases of keratitis can usually be effectively treated without loss of vision.

       " 'Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive, fatal neurologic disorder of childhood and early adolescence. It is caused by a persistent infection of the brain by an aberrant measles virus. Signs attributable to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis usually develop 4-8 years after the onset of measles infection. It is not precisely known how the measles virus remains dormant for so many years and why it becomes active again. More recent data indicate that it can follow acute measles infection in 1:10,000 cases. The incidence of SSPE is inversely related to measles vaccination coverage. In the developed world, the prevalence of SSPE has steadily declined since the introduction of the measles virus vaccine. The characteristic clinical manifestations of SSPE include behavioral abnormalities, cognitive decline, myoclonic jerks, seizures and abnormalities in vision. Clinical manifestations of SSPE usually start with subtle intellectual deterioration of the affected child causing deterioration in school performance. One of the most characteristic manifestations of SSPE is periodic myoclonic jerks that often leads to difficulty in walking and repeated falls. In the terminal stages of the disease, decerebrate and decorticate rigidity appear. Ultimately the patient becomes vegetative. Management of the disease includes seizure control and avoidance of secondary complications associated with the progressive disability. Treatment with interferon, ribavirin, and isoprinosine have reported beneficial results. However, there is no definitively effective treatment for SSPE.',\n",

This XY chromosome pair includes the X chromosome from the egg and the Y chromosome from the sperm. In Down syndrome, there is an additional copy of chromosome 21, resulting in three copies instead of the normal two copies.Down syndrome is a genetic disorder caused when abnormal cell division results in an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21. This extra genetic material causes the developmental changes and physical features of Down syndrome.Down syndrome varies in severity among individuals, causing lifelong intellectual disability and developmental delays. It's the most common genetic chromosomal disorder and cause of learning disabilities in children. It also commonly causes other medical abnormalities, including heart and gastrointestinal disorders.Better understanding of Down syndrome and early interventions can greatly increase the quality of life for children and adults with this disorder and help them live fulfilling lives.Products & ServicesBook: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book, 5th EditionNewsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital EditionShow more products from Mayo Clinic\",\n",

XP is classified into eight genetic complementation groups by the present. In this inside, 7 groups from the XP-A group to the G group show the abnormality in nucleotide excision repair (NER). The symptoms of XP begin in early life. Severe sunburn and blistering occurs in a half of patients, and all show early extensive freckling. Cancer incidence for individuals with XP under 20 years of age is 2,000 times as high as incidence in the general population. Neurodegeneration can be correlated with mutations in specific XP genes (XPA, ERCC3, ERCC2 and ERCC5).',\n",

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector. Therefore loss of RASSF1A might shift the balance of RAS activity towards a growth-promoting effect.',\n",

Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neoplasm, which accounts for approximately 25% of all lung cancer cases. Molecular mechanisms altered in SCLC include induced expression of oncogene, MYC, and loss of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, PTEN, RB, and FHIT. The overexpression of MYC proteins in SCLC is largely a result of gene amplification. Such overexpression leads to more rapid proliferation and loss of terminal differentiation. Mutation or deletion of p53 or PTEN can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis.

       " 'Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a rare but very aggressive tumor that arises from mesothelial cells lining the pleural, peritoneal and pericardial cavities. Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is the most common type, accounting for about 70% of all MM cases. Past asbestos exposure represents the major risk factor for MPM, as the link between asbestos fibres and MPM has been largely proved by epidemiological and experimental studies. Recently, simian virus 40 (SV40) has been implicated in the aetiology of MPM. The accumulation of numerous clonal chromosomal deletions in most MMs suggests a multistep process of tumorigenesis, characterized by the loss and/or inactivation of multiple tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). Cytogenetic and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses of MMs have demonstrated frequent deletions of specific sites within chromosome arms 1p, 3p, 6q, 9p, 13q, 15q, and 22q. Furthermore, TSGs within two of these regions, i.e., p16/CDKN2A-p14ARF at 9p21 and NF2 at 22q12, are frequently altered in MMs. Mutations of the p53 gene (TP53) are occasionally observed in MMs.',\n",
       " 'Melanoma is a form of skin cancer that has a poor prognosis and which is on the rise in Western populations. Melanoma arises from the malignant transformation of pigment-producing cells, melanocytes. The only known environmental risk factor is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and in people with fair skin the risk is greatly increased. Melanoma pathogenesis is also driven by genetic factors. Oncogenic NRAS mutations activate both effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may also be activated via mutations in the BRAF gene. The PI3K-Akt pathway may be activated through loss or mutation of the inhibitory tumor suppressor gene PTEN. These mutations arise early during melanoma pathogenesis and are preserved throughout tumor progression. Melanoma development has been shown to be strongly associated with inactivation of the p16INK4a/cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6/retinoblastoma protein (p16INK4a/CDK4,6/pRb) and p14ARF/human double minute 2/p53 (p14ARF/HMD2/p53) tumor suppressor pathways.

Approximately 200000 cases of SCC develop per year, causing about 2000 deaths. Unlike BCCs, which have no known precursor lesions, SCCs can emerge from actinic keratoses. As with BCC, risk for development of SCC is strongly influenced by the nature and dose of UV radiation and genetic backgrounds that regulate that interaction. Mutations in TP53 have been described in actinic keratoses, in situ SCC, and invasive SCC with UV signature lesions common, and a reported mutation rate as high as 45%. As with TP53, UV-induced mutations in HRAS and KRAS have also been characterized in both actinic keratoses and SCC. The reported frequency of RAS mutations in SCCs ranges from approximately 10% to almost 50%. Several recent studies have also reported mutations of p16 in up to 24% of SCCs. In addition to UV, a pathogenic role for human papillomavirus (HPV) in the development of SCC has also been proposed.',\n",

Ultraviolet (UV) radiation may be a cause, and corresponds with the sites of these tumours, often on sun-exposed skin, mostly (94%) in the White population. UV light may exert local immunomodulating action as it decreases amount of epidermal T cells and Langerhans cells, inducing hapten tolerance. Additionally, UV- specific mutations in TP53 and Harvey (Ha)-RAS genes are present in some MCC cell lines. Recently, the polyomavirus group has been linked with MCC. The MCC polyomavirus (MCPyV) has been isolated from MCC tissue and thought to be present in up to 80% of MCC.

Evidence indicates that KS progression occurs upon the deregulated expression of anti-apoptotic genes (Bcl-2), oncogenes (c-myc, c-int, ras) and oncosuppressor genes (TP53), and is associated with the long-lasting expression of HHV8 latency genes (LANA, v-cyc D, v-FLIP, Kaposin). All these genes are, in fact, expressed or altered in most KS spindle cells in the nodular-late stage of KS. Bcl-2 acts as a major KS progression factor, and TP53 and c-myc may also have a role in disease progression. HHV8 latency gene products may be involved in KS progression due to their capability of promoting cell growth by direct effects or antiapoptotic effects.',\n",

RMS comprises a heterogeneous into two major histologic subtypes, embryonal (ERMS) and alveolar (ARMS). Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) is a pediatric sarcoma that typically occurs in older children predominantly arising in the trunk and extremities, and exhibits a worse prognosis than other types of RMSs. ARMS is associated with 2;13 or 1;13 chromosomal translocations, which generate PAX3-FOXO1A and PAX7-FOXO1A fusion products, respectively. These translocations result in altered expression, function, and subcellular localization of the fusion products relative to the wild-type proteins, and ultimately contribute to oncogenic behavior by modifying growth, differentiation, and apoptosis pathways.',\n",

Recent genetic and immunohistochemical studies strongly suggest that high-grade serous adenocarcinoma (SAC) involving the ovary likely arises from distal fallopian tube epithelium, indicating that some ovarian cancers develop in the fallopian tube and are then spread to the ovary. Fallopian tube cancers are similar to ovarian cancer with respect to the proportion of tumors with abnormal expression of c-erbB-2 and p53. It has been proposed that the p53 signature is the earliest step in the pathogenesis of fallopian tube cancer. In this model, tubal epithelium on the fimbria experiences genotoxic damage and, as a result, the secretory cell exhibits over-accumulation of p53 protein (p53 signature).

       " 'Renal cell cancer (RCC) accounts for ~3% of human malignancies and its incidence appears to be rising. Although most cases of RCC seem to occur sporadically, an inherited predisposition to renal cancer accounts for 1-4% of cases. RCC is not a single disease, it has several morphological subtypes. Conventional RCC (clear cell RCC) accounts for ~80% of cases, followed by papillary RCC (10-15%), chromophobe RCC (5%), and collecting duct RCC (<1%). Genes potentially involved in sporadic neoplasms of each particular type are VHL, MET, BHD, and FH respectively. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Activated MET mediates a number of biological effects including motility, invasion of extracellular matrix, cellular transformation, prevention of apoptosis and metastasis formation. Loss of functional FH leads to accumulation of fumarate in the cell, triggering inhibition of HPH and preventing targeted pVHL-mediated degradation of HIF-alpha. BHD mutations cause the Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome and its associated chromophobe, hybrid oncocytic, and conventional (clear cell) RCC.',\n",

Nearly all (90 %) of WNT patients have somatic missense mutations in CTNNB1 which promote protein stabilization. Alterations in SHH subgroup most often fall within the Shh signalling pathway. The most common are somatic or germline inactivating alterations or loss of PTCH1 and SUFU, or somatic missense mutations activating SMO. Group 3 tumors are characterized by MYC amplification resulting in high MYC mRNA expression levels compared with SHH and Group 4 tumors.The most frequently mutated somatic gene in Group 4 medulloblastoma is KDM6A, a histone H3 Lys27 (H3K27) demethylase.',\n",

A subset of MTC cases is hereditary and due to germline mutations in the RET tyrosine kinase receptor gene. Somatic mutations in either RET or RAS are also present in most sporadic tumors.

The pathogenesis and progression of PGLs are very strongly influenced by genetics. A germline mutation in one of the susceptibility genes identified so far explains ~40% of all cases; the remaining 60% are thought to be sporadic cases. Sporadic as well as hereditary PGLs have been divided in two main clusters linked to two different signalling pathways: the first cluster contains all VHL-, SDHx-, and FH- mutated tumors and is associated to the activation of hypoxic pathway, while the second cluster contains all RET- , NF1-, MAX and TMEM127- mutated tumors and is associated to the activation of MAPK and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathways.',\n",

About 95% of cases are classical HL, and 5% are nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL). A characteristic feature of HL is the rareness of the tumor cells, which are called Hodgkin's and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical HL and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells in NLPHL. These cells represent only about 1% of the cellular infiltrate, while the vast majority of infiltrating cells are T lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes and plasma cells. HRS cells show constitutive activity of both the classical and alternative NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways, which is probably a major pathogenetic mechanism in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The NF-{kappa}B activity in HRS cells is probably mediated by diverse mechanisms: receptor signalling through CD40, RANK, BCMA, and TACI, genomic REL amplification, destructive mutations in IKBA and IKBE. In HL pathogenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, the activation of NF-{kappa}B is induced by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).\",\n",

The natural history of CML has a triphasic clinical course comprising of an initial chronic phase (CP), which is characterized by expansion of functionally normal myeloid cells, followed by an accelerated phase (AP) and finally a more aggressive blast phase (BP), with loss of terminal differentiation capacity. On the cellular level, CML is associated with a specific chromosome abnormality, the t(9; 22) reciprocal translocation that forms the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome is the result of a molecular rearrangement between the c-ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9 and the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22. The BCR/ABL fusion gene encodes p210 BCR/ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. While fusion of c-ABL and BCR is believed to be the primary cause of the chronic phase of CML, progression to blast crisis requires other molecular changes. Common secondary abnormalities include mutations in TP53, RB, and p16/INK4A, or overexpression of genes such as EVI1.

Its clinical presentation is variable and ranges from isolated skin or bone disease to a life-threatening multisystem condition. Historically, it has been hypothesized that the disease originated from epidermal Langerhans cells. However, new evidence supports a model in which LCH occurs as a consequence of a misguided differentiation programme of myeloid dendritic cell precursors. In LCH, there is a very high frequency of activating mutations in MAPK signaling pathway genes, most notably BRAF-V600E, as well as MAP2K1. Genetic, molecular and functional data implicate activation of the MAPK (ERK) signalling pathway at critical stages in myeloid differentiation as an essential and universal driver of LCH pathology.',\n",

A number of HES subtypes, or variants, have recently been identified. The best characterized of the clonal molecular defects implicated in myeloproliferative variant HES is the 800-kb interstitial deletion on chromosome 4q12 resulting in the fusion of 2 distinct genes, Fip1-like 1 (FIP1L1) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-a (PDGFRA), leading to the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion kinase. PDGFR is a membrane-bound tyrosine kinase receptor and the fusion PDGFRA kinase has constitutive/unregulated tyrosine kinase activity. The lymphocytic HES variant is associated with T-cell clones producing interleukin-5 (IL-5) and can evolve into lymphoma.

       " \"Allograft rejection is the consequence of the recipient's alloimmune response to nonself antigens expressed by donor tissues. After transplantation of organ allografts, there are two pathways of antigen presentation. In the direct pathway, recipient T cells react to intact allogeneic MHC molecules expressed on the surface of donor cells. This pathway would activate host CD4 or CD8 T cells. In contrast, donor MHC molecules (and all other proteins) shed from the graft can be taken up by host APCs and presented to recipient T cells in the context of self-MHC molecules - the indirect pathway. Such presentation activates predominantly CD4 T cells. A direct cytotoxic T-cell attack on graft cells can be made only by T cells that recognize the graft MHC molecules directly. Nontheless, T cells with indirect allospecificity can contribute to graft rejection by activating macrophages, which cause tissue injury and fibrosis, and are also likely to be important in the development of an alloantibody response to graft.\",\n",

Damaged tissues secrete inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha ). During step 2, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) trigger the activation of donor-derived T cells, which induce further T-cell expansion, induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells responses and prime additional mononuclear phagocytes to produce TNF-alpha and IL-1. Also, nitric oxide (NO) is produced by activated macrophages, and it may contribute to the tissue damage seen during step 3.

Cancer therapy is the priority for these patients. As for the remaining cases, no antibodies to P/Q-type VGCCs have been found in 10-15% of patients with LEMS. The fact that these seronegative patients positively respond to immunotherapy leads to the presumption that antibodies to other proteins might play a role in LEMS. Diagnosis of LEMS is ascertained on the basis of clinical symptoms and is further supported by electrophysiological and serological tests. The clinical triad in LEMS consists of weakness predominantly affecting proximal muscle groups, autonomic dysfunctions, and areflexia.

       " \"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), formerly also known as Bechterew's disease, is a rheumatic disease of the axial skeleton that mainly affects the spine and the sacroiliac joint in the pelvis. AS is one of a group of inflammatory diseases, called spondyloarthritides, which share features. This disease is characterized by erosion, sclerosis, and ossification, which may result in complete fusion and rigidity of the spine. Regarding extra-articular manifestations, the most frequent is anterior uveitis. The major functional losses occur during the first 10 years of disease. It usually begins in the second or third decade of life, preferentially in HLA-B27-positive Caucasian males. Its etiology and pathogenesis are not completely understood, but the most prevalent hypothesis involves immune mediation as its major mechanism, including several cytokines. To date, more than 40 genetic variants have been identified that influence the risk of developing AS, including HLA alleles such as HLA-B27.\",\n",
       " 'Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic inflammatory liver disorder with an etiology that remains unclear. The pathogenesis may be a result of alterations in immune tolerance, a genetic predisposition and environmental conditions, which in collaboration induce a T-cell-mediated attack on liver antigens, leading to necro-inflammation and liver damage. AIH has marked female predilection. AIH can present at all ages, but the two peak ages of incidence are in childhood or adolescence and at around 40 years of age. Trademark biochemical/serological characteristics of AIH are elevated aminotransferase levels, positivity for autoantibodies and increased IgG. A histological picture of interface hepatitis is typical of AIH. The value of immunosuppressive therapy with glucocorticoids, alone or in combination with azathioprine, was well documented in numerous studies of AIH.',\n",
       " \"Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by a combination of clinical features of systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, and polymyositis with elevated antibodies to U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1-RNP). The most common clinical manifestations of this disease are Raynaud's phenomenon, arthralgias, swollen joints, esophageal dysfunction, muscle weakness and fingers sausage-like appearance. The disease can be serious with development of pulmonary, kidney, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and central nervous system manifestations. The worst prognosis and high mortality are associated with the presence of pulmonary disease. Therapy should be individualised for each patient to address the specific organs involved and the severity of underlying disease activity. Inflammatory manifestations usually respond to steroid treatment, whereas clinical sclerodermatous manifestations such as sclerodactyly, and pulmonary interstitial disease more often require cytotoxic immunosuppressive treatment.\",\n",
       " 'Goodpasture syndrome (GS), or anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease, is a rare and organ-specific autoimmune disease defined by anti-GBM antibody-mediated damage (mainly immunoglobulin G-1) resulting in progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis and, frequently, diffuse pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage. Clinically, GS is characterized by pulmonary hemorrhage and renal failure, although the clinical spectrum may range from only mild symptoms to a relentless and finally lethal outcome. This disease accounts for 10-20% of the patients with acute renal failure following a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. The disease is caused by an autoimmune response against the non-collagenase domain of the alpha 3 chain of type IV collagen [alpha3(IV)NC1], found in the glomerular and alveolar basement membranes. Without prompt diagnosis and treatment, the disease can lead to bleeding in the lungs, kidney failure, and even death. Early and intensive treatment with plasmapheresis and immunosuppression with systemic corticosteroids pending results of diagnostic testing, and later cyclophosphamide, is often beneficial, with 90% of patients surviving the acute presentation of GS.',\n",
       " 'Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) represents a pattern of glomerular injury, characterized by mesangial proliferation and expansion, lobularization of the glomerular tufts and double contours. Classification of MPGN has been updated in the 2010s, and is now categorized according to the immunofluorescence microscopy findings. Until recently, the MPGNs have been distinguished according to the histological and ultra structural findings and were classified as MPGN type I, type II and type III. A new terminology that distinguishes immunoglobulin-mediated MPGN (ie, the former type I) from complement-mediated MPGN has been proposed. Immune-complexes mediated MPGN is caused by the deposition of immunocomplexes in the glomeruli. The immunocomplexes activate the classical pathway (CP) of complement and cause the deposition of complement factors or of the membrane attack complex (MAC) in the mesangium and capillary loops. The most frequent underlying disorders associated with immune complex MPGN include chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, and monoclonal gammopathies. The complement-mediated MPGN, termed C3 glomerulopathy, is characterised by defects in the alternative pathway of complement, in particular of factor H, or autoantibodies to complement-regulatory proteins (so-called C3 nephritic factors) leading to increased complement activation. The group includes dense deposit disease (DDD) and C3 glomerulonephritis. The two entities are distinguished on the basis of the immunohistological pattern of C3 and the electron microscopy detection of ribbon-like electron-dense deposits in the glomerular basement membrane in DDD, versus deposits of usual density in C3 glomerulonephritis.',\n",

It has been reported predominantly in Japan. This disease has specific features of elevated serum IgE level, active reaction to mite or cedar pollen specific antigen and stepwise progression of mostly the sensory symptoms. Atopic myelitis is often with coexistent atopic diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis and food allergies. Although the pathogenesis is still poorly understood, it has been reported that CCL11 and IL-9 were significantly increased in patients with atopic myelitis. Upregulation of CCL11 and IL-9 explain quite well the eosinophilic inflammation of the spinal cord. It has been suggested that immunotherapy, such as corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and plasma exchanges (PE), are effective in atopic myelitis, and that PE is the most beneficial immunotherapy.',\n",

Category (a) consists of agammaglobulinaemias. Defects in early B cell development are characterized by the onset of recurrent bacterial infections in the first 5 years of life, profound hypogammaglobulinemia, markedly reduced or absent B cells in the peripheral circulation, and (in the bone marrow) a severe block in B cell differentiation before the production of surface immunoglobulin-positive B cells. Mutations in Btk, the gene responsible for X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), account for approximately 85% of affected patients. Approximately half of the remaining patients have mutations in genes encoding components of the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) or BCR, including mu heavy chain (IGHM); the signal transduction molecules Ig-alpha (CD79A) and Ig-beta (CD79B); and lambda 5 (IGLL1), which forms the surrogate light chain with Vpre-B.

Category (b), hyper-IgM syndrome (HIM), represents a group of distinct entities characterized by defective normal or elevated IgM in the presence of diminished IgG and IgA levels. Seventy per cent of the cases are X-linked in inheritance, and others are autosomal recessive. In the autosomal recessive hyper IgM syndromes, the problem lies in the nucleotide-editing enzymes AICD or UNG. These enzymes are only present in the germinal center B cells, and defects in either disrupt B-cell development and antibody production. Patients with these syndromes typically have recurrent bacterial infections and often have lymphoid hyperplasia.',\n",

Patients have variable hypogammaglobulinemia but typically have profound reduction or absence of two or more Ig isotypes. This leads to severe immunodeficiency and death due to infection often before adulthood. Deficiencies of B-cell receptors are caused by mutations in the genes that encode immunoglobulin heavy or light chains or their associated signaling molecules, leading to agammaglobulinemia or hypogammaglobulinemia. Mutations in immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes (such as gamma1, 2, 3, or 4; alpha1 or 2; and epsilon) cause deficiencies of individual classes or subclasses of immunoglobulins, but circulating B cells are present and overall antibody function is usually normal. Mutations in the kappa light-chain gene result in a population of immunoglobulin molecules with only lambda light chains instead of the usual mixture of kappa and lambda types.',\n",

Mutations in either chain of the IFN-gammaR lead to severe susceptibility to mycobacteria and are very difficult to treat. Mutations in IL-12p40 or IL-12R beta 1 are milder clinically and can be treated with IFN-gamma because that receptor is still intact. Complete recessive mutations in STAT1 are more severe than any of the others because they affect both IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha signaling.',\n",

CD16 is part of the FcgRIII found on NK cells as well as macrophages and some T cells. The receptor allows NK cells to phagocytose organisms or cells coated with IgG in the absence of MHC (antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity). The mutation disrupts NK cell function and is associated with NK cytopenia. The patient also had severe clinical problems after BCG vaccination.',\n",
       " 'Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) comprises a heterogeneous group of monogenic disorders that result in early-onset severe infections by a range of pathogens (such as bacteria, viruses and fungi). Typically, patients with SCID have a severe defect in T-cell differentiation, along with direct or indirect impairment of B-cell development and function. SCIDs with lack of circulating T cells but a normal number of B cells accounts for 30 to 50% of all cases of human SCIDs. The most frequent form of SCID, X-linked SCID (SCID-X1), is caused by mutations in the gamma-chain-encoding gene. Gamma-chain is a common subunit shared by several cytokine receptors. It results in an absence of both mature T lymphocytes and NK lymphocytes. The second most common variant is autosomal recessive and due to mutations of the JAK3 gene. IL-7R alpha gene mutations result in a pure T-cell deficiency. Rare cases of SCID consisting of pure T-cell deficiencies have been attributed to defects in key proteins involved in pre-TCR/TCR signaling. Deficiency in the CD45 phosphatase has been reported in two cases of SCID, while defects in CD3 delta, CD3 epsilon and CD zeta have also been described.',\n",

Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency accounts for about half of the autosomal recessive forms of SCIDs. It is one of the most severe immunodeficiencies and is associated with severe depletion of B cells, T cells, and NK cells. V(D)J- recombination deficiency caused by defects in recombinase-activating gene 1 (RAG1), RAG2 and Artemis (DCLRE1C) leads to a T-B-SCID phenotype that is characterized by an arrest of B- and T-cell maturation at the stage of pro-B and pre-T cells, respectively, whereas natural killer (NK)-cell maturation is not affected.

Hyper-IgM syndrome (HIM) represents a group of distinct entities characterized by defective normal or elevated IgM in the presence of diminished IgG and IgA levels. The genetic anomaly in X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome has been mapped to Xq26, and resides in mutations of the CD40 ligand gene. Missense mutation in exon 7 of the common gamma chain (IL2RG) causes a moderate form of X-linked CID. This point mutation in IL2RG leads to a less severe degree of deficiency in cellular and humoral immunity than that seen in XSCID. Two related deficiencies of recombination activating genes, RAG1 and RAG2 result in a spectrum of SCID called RAG1/RAG2 deficiency and Omenn syndrome. Mutations that lead to total absence of RAG1 or RAG2 gene product (null mutations) are known to lead to SCID without mature lymphoid cells, whereas mutations that result in partial V(D)J recombinase activity due to missense mutation on at least one allele lead to Omenn syndrome. Mutations of both TAP1 and TAP2 genes result in deficient expression of class I HLA proteins on the cell surface with defects in natural killer cell cytotoxicity. Defective expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules account for 5% of SCID. The genetic lesions responsible for this syndrome do not lie within the MHC-II locus itself, but reside instead in genes encoding transcription factors, RFX5, RFXAP, RFXANK(B), and CIITA, controlling MHC-II expression. ZAP-70 deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Recurrent and opportunistic infections occur within the first year of life. The mutations in genes responsible for CRAC channel function, ORAI1 and STIM1, cause the defect in Ca2+ influx.',\n",

They include C1 inhibitor (C1-INH, also termed SERPING1), C4 binding protein (C4BP), Factor I, decay accelerating factor (DAF), CD59, and so on. C1-INH (SERPING1) deficiency can be genetic or acquired, and this causes an episodic, local increase in vascular permeability in the subcutaneous and submucosal layers, identified as angioedema (hereditary or acquired). Genetic deficiency of C4BP has only been reported in one individual who developed an illness with similarities to Behcet's syndrome. Heterozygous mutations within the Factor I gene have been recently identified in individuals with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), while homozygous deficiency of Factor I is an unusual feature. Factor I-deficient patients present high susceptibility to respiratory tract infections and meningitis. Kidney impairment and autoimmune disorders have also been observed. Only a single case of CD59 deficiency has been reported and this individual developed a paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria(PNH)-like illness.

Several nonsense and missense mutations as well as deletions and insertions of the WAS gene have been identified in WAS patients. DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome (DGS) is a congenital immune disorder characterized by lack of embryonic development or underdevelopment of the thymus and surrounding organs. The DGS is a member of a group of disorders that have in common a chromosome deletion involving 22q11.2 (the DiGeorge syndrome chromosome region, or DGCR). Hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES) is characterized by atopic dermatitis associated with extremely high serum IgE levels and susceptibility to infections with extracellular bacteria. Dominant-negative mutations in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) gene result in the classical multisystem form of HIES, whereas a null mutation in the tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) gene causes an autosomal recessive HIES associated with viral and mycobacterial infections. X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP) is a rare primary immunodeficiency, with manifestations ranging from fatal infectious mononucleosis to B cell lymphomas and hypogammaglobulinemia. Mutations in the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) as well as in a distinct gene, SLAM-associated protein (SAP/DSP1/SH2D1A) have been identified in patients with XLP. Recently, it has been shown that a homozygous mutation in the SH2 domain of the IL-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) gene is associated with fatal Epstein Barr virus associated lymphoproliferation, with a clinical picture similar to that seen in XLP. Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy and X-linked (IPEX) syndrome and autoimmune polyendocrinopathy, candidiasis, ectodermal dysplasia (APECED) are examples of dysregulated immunity resulting in a disturbed tolerance and multiple autoimmune phenomena. IPEX is caused by mutations in the FOXP3 gene, and APECED results from mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene.

       " 'Sydenham chorea is a disabling pediatric hyperkinetic and neuropsychiatric disorder following streptococcal infection. Sydenham chorea occurs in approximately 10% of acute rheumatic fever and is one of its major manifestations. The disease may last for weeks or months, with a high risk of recurrence. The common features of rheumatic fever include sore throats due to streptococcal infections, rashes, pains in the limbs, and subcutaneous nodules, and this form of chorea typically presents, after varying intervals, with twitching of the mouth and limbs, shrugging of the shoulders, and clumsy gait. Those with this form of chorea are less likely to have severe cardiac or rheumatologic complications. The pathogenesis has been considered to be an autoantibody-mediated basal ganglia dysfunction. Anti-inflammatory treatments such as steroids, plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment are effective.',\n",

       " 'Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specfically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. It was proposed that Abeta form Ca2+ permeable pores and bind to and modulate multiple synaptic proteins, including NMDAR, mGluR5 and VGCC, leading to the overfilling of neurons with calcium ions. Consequently, cellular Ca2+ disruptions will lead to neuronal apoptosis, autophagy deficits, mitochondrial abnormality, defective neurotransmission, impaired synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration in AD. FAD-linked PS1 mutation downregulates the unfolded protein response and leads to vulnerability to ER stress.',\n",

       " 'Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder that results primarily from the death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Both environmental factors and mutations in familial PD-linked genes such as SNCA, Parkin, DJ-1, PINK1 and LRRK2 are associated with PD pathogenesis. These pathogenic mutations and environmental factors are known to cause disease due to oxidative stress, intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis impairment, mitochondrial dysfunctions and altered protein handling compromising key roles of DA neuronal function and survival. The demise of DA neurons located in the SNc leads to a drop in the dopaminergic input to the striatum, which is hypothesized to impede movement by inducing hypo and hyper activity in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the direct (dSPNs) and indirect (iSPNs) pathways in the basal ganglia, respectively.',\n",

Point mutations, duplications and triplications in the alpha-synuclein gene cause a rare dominant form of PS in families. Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene have been identified as a much more common cause for dominant PS, especially in certain ethnic groups, while mutations in the parkin gene, in DJ-1, PINK1 and ATP13A2 cause autosomal recessive parkinsonism of early onset.',\n",

The symptoms are choreiform, involuntary movements, personality changes and dementia. HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the IT15 gene, which results in a long stretch of polyglutamine (polyQ) close to the amino-terminus of the HD protein huntingtin (Htt). Mutant Htt (mHtt) has effects both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Full-length Htt is cleaved by proteases in the cytoplasm, leading to the formation of cytoplasmic and neuritic aggregates. mHtt also alters vesicular transport and recycling, causes cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+\\xa0\\xa0overload, triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress through proteasomal dysfunction, and impairs autophagy function, increasing neuronal death susceptibility.

       " 'Prion diseases, also termed transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases that affect humans and a number of other animal species. The etiology of these diseases is thought to be associated with the conversion of a normal protein, PrPC, into an infectious, pathogenic form, PrPSc. The conversion is induced by prion infections (for example, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), iatrogenic CJD, Kuru), mutations (familial CJD, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia (FFI)) or unknown factors (sporadic CJD (sCJD)), and is thought to occur after PrPC has reached the plasma membrane or is re-internalized for degradation. The PrPSc form shows greater protease resistance than PrPC and accumulates in affected individuals, often in the form of extracellular plaques. Pathways that may lead to neuronal death comprise oxidative stress, regulated activation of complement, ubiquitin-proteasome and endosomal-lysosomal systems, synaptic alterations and dendritic atrophy, corticosteroid response, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. In addition, the conformational transition could lead to the lost of a beneficial activity of the natively folded protein, PrPC.',\n",

But these variants other than EA1 and EA2 are rare, some only occurring in single families, and gene mutations have not been identified in all. It is quite likely, however, that the number of phenotypes and mutated genes will grow further.',\n",
       " 'Neuroacanthocytosis (NA) syndromes are a heterogeneous group of diseases in which nervous system abnormalities coincide with red blood cell acanthocytosis. Core NA syndromes are one of the broad groups of NA disorders characterized by degeneration of the basal ganglia, movement disorders, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric features. NA syndromes are caused by disease-specific genetic mutations. The mechanism by which these mutations cause neurodegeneration is not known.',\n",
       " 'Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (AOA) is a group of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias mainly characterized by ataxia, oculomotor apraxia and choreoathetosis. AOA includes ataxia telangiectasia (AT), ataxia telangiectasia like disorder (ATLD), ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 1 (AOA1) and ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2). AT, ATLD, and AOA1 are due to homozygous mutations in genes encoding a protein involved in DNA repair. Ophthalmic features of AT include conjunctival telangiectasia, strabismus, saccadic dysfunction with head thrusts, and convergence insufficiency. AOA1 is typically characterized by early-onset cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia and late axonal sensori-motor neuropathy. The gene mutated in AOA2, SETX, encodes senataxin, a putative DNA/RNA helicase which has been shown to play a role in the response to oxidative stress.',\n",
       " 'Distal hereditary motor neuropathies (dHMN) comprise a heterogenous group of diseases that share the common feature of a length-dependent predominantly motor neuropathy. Many forms of dHMN have minor sensory abnormalities and/or a significant upper-motor-neuron component, and there is often an overlap with the axonal forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) [DS:H00264] and with juvenile forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [DS:H00058] and hereditary spastic paraplegia [DS:H00266]. The causative genes with autosomal dominant, recessive, and X-linked patterns of inheritance have implicated proteins with diverse functions. Distal HMN are classified into phenotypic subtypes according to age at onset, mode of inheritance, and presence of additional features.',\n",
       " 'Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM), also referred to as childhood ataxia with diffuse central nervous system hypomyelination (CACH), is one of the most prevalent inherited childhood disorders of cerebral white matter. This autosomal recessive progressive neurological disorder usually begins in early childhood, but a wide spectrum of clinical severity is now recognized from fatal infantile forms such as Cree leukoencephalopathy to mild later-onset forms associated with ovarian failure. The principal findings are cerebellar ataxia and spasticity with relative preservation of mental abilities. Nearly all patients have mutations in any of the 5 genes encoding the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2B. Mutated eIF2B could impair the ability of cells to regulate protein synthesis, especially under conditions of cell stress.',\n",
       " 'Leukoencephalopathy, progressive, with ovarian failure has a clinical presentation previously described as ovarioleukodystrophy. Some of the patients have a variant of vanishing white matter disease with mutations in subunits of EIF2B. Recently, novel phenotype related to AARS2 mutations has been reported. AARS2 encodes mitochondrial alanyl-tRNA synthetase. Patients with AARS2 mutations had childhood- to adulthood-onset signs of neurologic deterioration consisting of ataxia, spasticity, and cognitive decline. Female patients had ovarian failure.',\n",
       " 'Leukoencephalopathy with brain stem and spinal cord involvement and brain lactate elevation (LBSL) is an autosomal recessive juvenile to adult-onset white matter disorder presenting with slowly progressive pyramidal, cerebellar and dorsal column dysfunction, often leading to wheelchair dependency before age 30 years. LBSL is caused by mutations in the gene DARS2, which codes for mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (mtAspRS).',\n",
       " 'Leukoencephalopathy with dystonia and motor neuropathy is a disorder caused by a deficiency of sterol carrier protein-2 (SCPx), a peroxisomal enzyme with thiolase activity, which is required for the breakdown of branched-chain fatty acids. The patient presents with torticollis and dystonic head tremor as well as slight cerebellar signs with intention tremor, nystagmus, hyposmia, and azoospermia.',\n",
       " 'Leukodystrophy and acquired microcephaly with or without dystonia (LDAMD) is a syndrome caused by a mutation in PLEKHG2, that encodes RhoGEF protein. PLEKHG2 has an effect on the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton.',\n",
       " 'Megaloencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC) is a rare leukodystrophy characterized by macrocephaly and a slowly progressive clinical course marked by spasticity and cognitive decline. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows bilateral extensive white-matter changes with cysts in the temporal regions. Based on the clinical and MRI features, MLC can be distinguished from other conditions (ie, Alexander disease [DS:H00065], Canavan disease [DS:H00074], glutaric acidemia type I [DS:H00178]) that present in infancy with megalencephaly. An autosomal recessive mutations in the MLC1 gene have been shown to cause this condition. Recently, mutations in HEPACAM gene are reported to be associated with MLC.',\n",
       " 'Cystic leukoencephalopathy without megalencephaly is an autosomal recessive infantile-onset neurological disorder. The affected individuals are asymptomatic at birth and show a static encephalopathy with normo- or microcephaly and psychomotor impairment within the first year of life. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows bilateral anterior temporal lobe cystic lesions and enlarged inferior horns combined with multifocal white matter alterations. Loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the RNASET2 glycoprotein lead to this disorder.',\n",
